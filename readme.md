# Linux Driver

This repository contains the code of a video series about Linux drivers.

I'm following the playlist of Johannes 4GNU_Linux. You can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCGpd0Do5-I3b5TtyqeF1UdyD4C-S-dMa).

This repo contains my notes and code examples. Some time a just write extra information that I think is important.
